      <h2>About Me</h2>
     <!-- <p>I use data engineering to solve real problems whether it's building cloud architectures, streamlining pipelines, or enabling teams to make better decisions.
         Below are some of the projects I'm proud of. For a full background, see <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wendyebanks/">my LinkedIn</a></strong>. </p> -->

     <p>I work as a Data Engineer and Architect, helping teams build systems that solve real problems—whether that's designing cloud data platforms,
       improving pipelines, or making data easier to access and use.</p>
     <p>Over the years, I’ve worked across different levels of the organization, from hands-on development to architectural planning. 
       I focus on building solutions that are reliable, scalable, and aligned with business goals—while keeping things clear and collaborative along the way.</p>
     <p>I’ve found that strong communication and teamwork go a long way when navigating complex projects. They’re what keep things moving and make great outcomes possible.
       Below are a few examples of my work. You can find more details on <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wendyebanks/">my LinkedIn</a></strong>.</p>

             A community-led environmental monitoring program that collects weekly water samples from multiple locations to track water quality.

              This project turns unstructured digital assets—photos, videos, audio—into an immersive VR gallery using Metaverse-as-a-Service (MaaS).
              Designed with data engineering and architecture principles, it offers an engaging experience for non-technical users while supporting advanced analysis
              through APIs, metadata, and pipelines. By integrating Photovoice, it brings in real-world stories that add depth and context. 
              The result is a dual-purpose platform: a visually rich, accessible space for exploration, and a robust tool for data professionals and AI systems.
              It reimagines how we interact with and derive meaning from data. <a href="/Case_studies/case_study4.html">Read More...</a>

              The Data Observability Toolkit (DOT), developed by DataKind, is an open-source solution that helps organizations monitor and improve
              the quality of their data pipelines. It supports transparency, accuracy, and reliability by enabling error tracking, data flow monitoring,
              and better decision-making. While DOT offers powerful capabilities, its installation process can be complex—especially for users unfamiliar
              with tools like Docker, Apache Airflow, PostgreSQL, and AppSmith. This case highlights the importance of balancing robust functionality
              with accessibility in data observability solutions. <a href="/Case_studies/case_study2.html">Read more...</a>

            <p> This case study explored Florida’s affordable housing crisis by gathering and analyzing key housing and economic data.
              The goal was to spot trends and highlight where housing is hardest to afford—especially across different regions and communities.
              Florida shows how serious the national housing shortage has become, with over 10.8 million low-income families affected.
              In Florida, rising costs, climate risks, and financial hurdles make it even harder to find or keep a home. 
              The analysis helps make sense of these complex challenges and who they impact most. <a href="/Case_studies/case_study3.html">Read more...</a>

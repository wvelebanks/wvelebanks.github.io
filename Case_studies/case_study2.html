    </header>

    <h3>Role:</h3>
    <p> Data Analytics Engineer </p><br/>
    
     <!-- ========================================= -->
     <h3>1. Overview and Problem Statement</h3>
        <p> The <strong>Data Observability Toolkit (DOT)</strong>, developed by <strong>DataKind</strong>, is a robust open-source
        solution designed to help organizations monitor, track, and enhance the quality of their data pipelines. It enables reliable, 
        high-quality data for decision-making by providing error detection and data flow tracking.<br/>DOT offers powerful functionality, 
        the setup and installation process presented challenges, particularly for users who were not familiar with its underlying components, 
        such as <strong>Docker, Apache Airflow, PostgreSQL</strong>, and <strong>the AppSmith web interface</strong>.

	    The documentation, while comprehensive, could benefit from better structure and clarity. Some steps were difficult to follow, 
		and certain sections relied on an external video tutorial, which, though helpful, was not always accessible to everyone.<br/> 
		As a contributor, I helped streamline the installation process and restructure the documentation to make it more intuitive and user-friendly.
		Focusing on improving the clarity of the guide using Markdown to make the setup easier for new users and contributors, ensuring a 
		smoother experience for those interacting with DOT.

       <h3>2. Addressing Installation Complexities and Enhancing Documentation Usability</h3>
       <p> Upon reviewing the initial installation instructions for <strong>DataKind's Data Observability Toolkit (DOT)</strong>,
           I encountered several key challenges that made the setup process difficult for users:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lack of Structured Documentation:</strong> The instructions were contained in a lengthy README file with no clear structure, 
          which made it difficult to follow the steps in a logical sequence. Key details were often hidden within large blocks of text,
          causing confusion for users.</li>
        <li><strong>Dependence on Video Tutorial:</strong> The only clear guide available was an external video tutorial, which, 
           while helpful, posed <strong>accessibility issues</strong> for those who preferred written instructions or had limited internet access. 
           The lack of a written <strong>roadmap</strong> made it harder for users to follow the process independently. </li>
        <li> <strong>Missing Visual Cues:</strong> Some sections of the documentation lacked <strong>visual aids</strong>—
          such as screenshots or diagrams—that would help users understand key steps more intuitively.
          Without these, users were more likely to miss critical actions or configurations.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <p>Given these challenges, the goal was to <strong>refactor</strong> the documentation, <strong>improve
        clarity</strong>, and provide users with <strong>visual aids</strong> to make the process much easier.</p>
    
  <h3>3. My Role: Overhauling Documentation and Addressing Technical Constraints</h3>
       <p>As a collaborator on this project, I took several key steps to optimize the documentation and setup process:</p>
  
	 <h4>a. Testing the Installation Process</h4>
	  <h5>1. Docker Setup: </h5>
         <p>To begin, I <strong>recreated the environment</strong> locally using Docker to understand the software’s behavior. 
	       The original Docker setup instructions were unclear, so I tested the steps and restructured them to include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Building Docker Images</strong>: I provided step-by-step commands for building Docker images 
			    (docker build) and running containers (docker run).</li>
            <li><strong>Managing Volumes and Environment Variables</strong>: I clarified how to configure volumes and
				environment variables to ensure that the containerized environment mirrored production settings.</li>
          </ul>
	  <p><strong>Challenge</strong>: The original guide lacked clear details about Docker's container interaction, 
		  so I added instructions on how to manage <strong>dependencies</strong> between containers.</p>
    
	  <h5> 2. Apache Airflow Pipelines:</h5>
	  <p>I ensured that <strong>Apache Airflow</strong> could successfully execute the data pipeline.
		 The pipeline orchestration using Airflow requires defining <strong>DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs)</strong> 
		to schedule tasks, but the setup was difficult to follow in the original documentation.</p>
      <p><strong>Solution</strong>: I broke down the setup process into:</p>
	    <ul>
		   <li><strong>Configuring Airflow's Scheduler and Workers</strong>: Detailed steps on installing Apache
			   Airflow and setting up DAGs.</li>
           <li><strong>Monitoring DAGs</strong>: I added screenshots of the Airflow web UI to show users how to view 
			   and manage running tasks.</li>
        </ul>
	    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
          <figure>
                <img src="/images/Dot_Doc1.jpg" style="max-width: 85%; height: auto;" alt="visual aids 1" />      
          </figure>
         </div>
	  
       <h5> 3. PostgreSQL Database Configuration:</h5>
	   <p>The toolkit required connecting to a <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> database to store and retrieve data.
		   The initial documentation didn't provide clear instructions on configuring the database schema and connection.</p>
	  <p><strong>Solution</strong>: I added a section detailing:</p>
      
	  <ul>
       	   <li><strong>Database Setup</strong>: Steps for configuring the PostgreSQL container and defining the
			   necessary schemas and tables.</li>
           <li><strong>Connection Setup</strong>: How to configure the DOT software to connect to PostgreSQL securely.</li>
      </ul>

	     <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
          <figure>
                <img src="/images/DOTDB.jpg" style="max-width: 85%; height: auto;" alt="DOT DB connection" />      
          </figure>
         </div>
		
      <h4>b. Addressing Memory and Resource Constraints</h4>
      <p>One of the challenges during testing was understanding the <strong>memory and system resource requirements.</strong> 
		  the software can be resource-intensive, and I had to ensure that DOT would run smoothly on a variety of systems.</p>
      <h5>Findings:</h5>
      <ul>
          <li> DOT required at least <strong>8GB of RAM</strong> to run the basic setup but was more stable
			  with <strong>16GB</strong> for larger data sets.</li>
          <li> <p>To optimize for <strong>low-end systems</strong>, I recommended several configuration adjustments:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li> Reducing <strong>parallel task execution</strong> in Airflow to minimize CPU usage.</li>
                  <li> Setting <strong>Docker container memory limits</strong> (docker run --memory). </li>
             </ul>
          </li>
      </ul>
     <p>I documented these recommendations in the setup guide, giving users the flexibility to optimize based on their
		 available resources.</p>
	  
    <h4>c. Markdown Reformatting and Visual Aids</h4>
    <p>To improve the readability and usability of the documentation, I restructured the entire setup process using
		<strong>Markdown</strong>. This provided a clean, easy-to-follow format, especially for step-by-step instructions
		and code snippets.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Before</strong>: The original documentation was a long-form text document, making it hard for users to 
				find key information quickly.</li>
            <li><strong>After</strong>: I reorganized the instructions into <strong>sections</strong> (Docker, Airflow, PostgreSQL), 
				used <strong>code blocks</strong> for commands, and added <strong>headings</strong> to improve navigation.</li>
        </ul>
     <p>Additionally, I identified areas where visual aids (screenshots and diagrams) were needed. I integrated these visuals into
		 the documentation to make complex steps more intuitive.</p>
	  
	  <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
          <figure>
                <img src="/images/Dot_Doc2.jpg" style="max-width: 85%; height: auto;" alt="visual aids 2" />      
          </figure>
         </div>
	 
	 <h3>4. The Result: Cleaner Documentation and Easier Setup</h3>
     <p>After my intervention, the following improvements were made:</p>
     <ul>
         <li><strong>Structured, Easy-to-Follow Documentation</strong>: 
			 The instructions were now separated into clear sections, each with concise explanations and relevant code snippets.
			 <strong>Markdown</strong> provided a neat, organized layout, making it easy to follow.</li>
         <li><strong>Visual Aids</strong>: I incorporated <strong>screenshots</strong> to clarify complex steps,
			 such as building Docker images, configuring Airflow DAGs, and connecting to PostgreSQL.</li>
         <li><strong>Memory Optimization</strong>: I included recommendations for configuring the application based on 
			 available system memory, ensuring that it could run smoothly even on systems with limited resources.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>By addressing these issues, the setup process became <strong>more accessible</strong>, especially for users who had not worked with Docker, Airflow, or PostgreSQL before.</p>

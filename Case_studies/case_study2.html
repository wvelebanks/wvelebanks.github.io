     <h3>1. Overview and Problem Statement</h3>
        <p> The <strong>Data Observability Toolkit (DOT)</strong>, developed by <strong>DataKind</strong>, is a robust open-source
        solution designed to help organizations monitor, track, and enhance the quality of their data pipelines. It enables reliable, 
        high-quality data for decision-making by providing error detection and data flow tracking.DOT offers powerful functionality, 
        the setup and installation process presented challenges, particularly for users who were not familiar with its underlying components, 
        such as <strong>Docker, Apache Airflow, PostgreSQL</strong>, and <strong>the AppSmith web interface</strong>. The documentation, while comprehensive, could benefit
        from better structure and clarity. Some steps were difficult to follow, and certain sections relied on an external video tutorial, 
        which, though helpful, was not always accessible to everyone. As a contributor, I helped streamline the installation process 
        and restructure the documentation to make it more intuitive and user-friendly. Focusing on improving the clarity of the guide 
        using Markdown to make the setup easier for new users and contributors, ensuring a smoother experience for those interacting
        with DOT.</p>

       <h2>2. Addressing Installation Complexities and Enhancing Documentation Usability</h2>
       <p> Upon reviewing the initial installation instructions for <strong>DataKind's Data Observability Toolkit (DOT)</strong>,
           I encountered several key challenges that made the setup process difficult for users:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Lack of Structured Documentation:</strong> The instructions were contained in a lengthy README file with no clear structure, 
            which made it difficult to follow the steps in a logical sequence. Key details were often hidden within large blocks of text,
            causing confusion for users.</li>
          <li><strong>Dependence on Video Tutorial:</strong> The only clear guide available was an external video tutorial, which, 
              while helpful, posed <strong>accessibility issues</strong> for those who preferred written instructions or had limited internet access. 
             The lack of a written <strong>roadmap</strong> made it harder for users to follow the process independently. </li>
          <li> <strong>Missing Visual Cues:</strong> Some sections of the documentation lacked <strong>visual aids</strong>—
            such as screenshots or diagrams—that would help users understand key steps more intuitively.
            Without these, users were more likely to miss critical actions or configurations.</li>
        </ul>

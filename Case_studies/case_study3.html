      <h1>Florida’s Affordable Housing Crisis: A Data-Driven View</h1>
    </header>
    <h3> 1. Overview & Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>The United States is facing a deepening affordable housing crisis, with a national shortage of over 7 million affordable homes impacting more than <br/>
           10.8 million extremely low-income families. In every state, even working full time at minimum wage is not enough to afford a modest two-bedroom apartment.<br/> 
           Florida, in particular, exemplifies this crisis. With rapidly rising housing costs, significant environmental vulnerabilities,<br/> 
           and financial barriers to homeownership, the state presents a complex challenge.
        </p><br/>
       
    <h4>Key consequences include:</h4>
    <ul>
       <li><strong>70% of low-income families</strong>strong> are severely cost-burdened, spending over half their income on rent.</li>
       <li>A growing number of residents are displaced or forced into “super commutes.”</li>
       <li>Climate vulnerabilities, particularly flooding, disproportionately impact <strong>Black, Hispanic, and low-income communities.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This case study focuses on an analytical project conducted as part of the DataKind Challenge,<br/>
      using open-source data and demographic insights to examine housing challenges in Florida for the year 2020.
    </p><br/>

    <h3>2. Objective</h3>
       <span>The goal of this analysis was to: </span><br/>
       <ul>
          <li>Identify systemic barriers to housing affordability and accessibility in Florida.</li>
          <li>Examine the intersection of environmental risk, financial access, and socioeconomic inequality.</li>
          <li>Provide insights that can inform policy, investment, and community-level interventions.</li>
      </ul><br/>
    
    <h3>3. Methodology & Data Sources</h3>
    <p> 
       To enable a holistic and multidimensional analysis, the study used <strong>U.S. Census data</sytong>, mapping files,<br/> 
       and datasets provided by <strong>DataKind</strong>, organized into five main categories:
    </p><br/>
  
    <table border="1">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Dataset</th>
          <th>Focus</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Housing</td>
          <td>Availability, pricing, quality across regions</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Banking</td>
          <td>Mortgage rates, lending access, financial resources</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Environment</td>
          <td>Flood risk, pollution, proximity to services</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Economic Profile</td>
          <td>Income levels, employment rates, economic conditions</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Integrated</td>
          <td>Combined view for geographic and systemic analysis</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table><br/>
  
  <h3>4. Key Findings & Insights</h3><br/>
     <h4>4.1 Demographic Disparities</h4>
       <ul>
           <li>As of 2020, Florida’s population was <strong>36.8% White, 28.3% Black, 5.2% Asian, <br/> with 26% identifying as multi-racial or from other groups </strong> including Hispanic/Latino populations.</li>
           <li>By 2022, non-Hispanic White population rose to 52.3%, but Hispanic/Latino growth led with a <strong>>4.5 percentage point increase</strong>, emphasizing the state's increasing diversity.</li>
           <li><strong>Many minorities are overrepresented in high-risk flood zones</strong>, confirming environmental justice concerns (Mittan, 2020; Backenssen & Ma, 2020).</li>
       </ul><br/>
      <h4>4.2 Housing Affordability</h4>
      <ul>
         <li>Rents increased over <strong>30%</strong> between <strong>2020 and 2022</strong>.</li>
         <li><strong>Over one-third</strong> of low-income residents now spend more than <strong>30% of income on rent</strong>, squeezing budgets for essentials.</li>
         <li>Homeownership rates <strong>(~64-65%)</strong> lag slightly behind the national average, with urban renters disproportionately impacted by rising costs.</li>
      </ul><br/>
      <h4>4.3 Financial Constraints</h4>	
      <ul>
          <li>Florida’s <strong>Purchase Applications Payment Index (PAPI)</strong> reached <strong>228</strong>strong>, indicating one of the highest cost burdens nationally.</li>
          <li>Median mortgage payments in 2024 were <strong>$2,600/month</strong>strong>, driven by prices exceeding <strong>$415,000</strong>strong> and rates above <strong>7%</strong>strong>.</li>
          <li>High denial rates and tightened lending standards disproportionately impact<br/> 
          <strong>low-income and minority applicants</strong>strong>, especially in <strong>urban counties</strong>.</li>
      </ul><br/>
 <h4>4.4 Environmental Risk & Exposure</h4><br/>
<ul>
  <li>Pollution sources include <strong>plastics, phosphate mining, fertilizers</strong>strong>, and <strong>aging infrastructure</strong>strong>.</li>
  <li>Areas with the <strong>highest pollution levels</strong>strong> (counties 20–27) also tend to have <strong>lower income</strong>strong> and <strong>higher minority populations</strong>strong>.</li>
  <li>Common environmental burdens include:
    <ul>
       <li>Wastewater contamination</li>
       <li>Air toxics</li>
       <li>Diesel pollution</li>
       <li>Lead exposure in older housing stock</li>
      </ul></li>
   </ul><br/>

    <h4>4.5 Intersections and Systemic Risk</h4><br/>
     <ul>
         <li>Combined analysis reveals that <strong>financial, environmental, and economic challenges are not isolated</strong>strong>,<br/>
              but compound for certain populations.</li>
         <li>Flood-prone zones overlap with <strong>affordable housing clusters</strong>,
              forcing vulnerable residents into <strong>high-risk</strong>strong> living situations.</li>
         <li>Environmental justice is a <strong>key lens</strong> through which housing policy must be evaluated</li>
    </ul><br/>

    <h3>5. Visual Insights</h3><br/>

    <h3>6. Policy & Design Considerations</h3><br/>
        <p>The data surfaced a number of opportunities that could inform policy and program design:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Targeted investment</strong> in affordable housing could help increase access in areas with lower environmental risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Promoting equitable lending practices</strong>, including anti-discrimination enforcement and incentives for fair credit access, may improve financial inclusion.</li>
        <li><strong>Incorporating climate resilience</strong> into housing development—particularly in coastal or flood-prone areas—could strengthen long-term stability.</li>
        <li><strong>Addressing environmental burdens</strong> in lower-income communities may contribute to improved health outcomes and livability.</li>
        <li><strong>Leveraging integrated datasets</strong>strong> could support more responsive, data-driven decision-making across housing and environmental planning.</li>
    </ul><br/>

    <h2>7. Conclusion</h2><br/>
    <p>
       Florida’s affordable housing crisis is complex and far-reaching. It affects not just where people live, but how they live — touching everything from income and race to flood risk and health.
       By bringing together data on housing, finances, the environment, and community demographics, this project paints a clearer picture of who is most affected and why.      
       This work shows that data isn’t just numbers — it’s a tool for understanding real lives. When we connect the dots, we can see where systems are failing and where action is most needed.
       With the right insights, we can move toward solutions that are not only practical, but fair — helping create safer, more affordable homes for all Floridians.

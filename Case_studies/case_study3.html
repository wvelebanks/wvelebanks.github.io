      <h1>Case Study: Tackling Florida’s Affordable Housing Crisis Through Data Integration and Environmental Justice Insights</h1></h1>
    </header>
    <h2> 1. Overview & Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>The United States is facing a deepening affordable housing crisis, with a national shortage of over 7 million affordable homes impacting more than <br/>
           10.8 million extremely low-income families. In every state, even working full time at minimum wage is not enough to afford a modest two-bedroom apartment.<br/> 
           Florida, in particular, exemplifies this crisis. With rapidly rising housing costs, significant environmental vulnerabilities,<br/> 
           and financial barriers to homeownership, the state presents a complex challenge.
        </p>
       
    <h2>Key consequences include:</h2>
    <ul>
       <li><bold>70% of low-income families</bold> are severely cost-burdened, spending over half their income on rent.</li>
       <li>A growing number of residents are displaced or forced into “super commutes.”</li>
       <li>•	Climate vulnerabilities, particularly flooding, disproportionately impact <bold>Black, Hispanic, and low-income communities.</bold></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This case study focuses on an analytical project conducted as part of the DataKind Challenge,<br/>
      using open-source data and demographic insights to examine housing challenges in Florida for the year 2020.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Objective</h2>
       <span>The goal of this analysis was to: </span><br/>
       <ul>
          <li>Identify systemic barriers to housing affordability and accessibility in Florida.</li>
          <li>Examine the intersection of environmental risk, financial access, and socioeconomic inequality.</li>
          <li>Provide insights that can inform policy, investment, and community-level interventions.</li>
      </ul>
    
    <h2>3. Methodology & Data Sources</h2>
    <p> 
       To enable a holistic and multidimensional analysis, the study used <bold>U.S. Census data</bold>, mapping files,<br/> 
       and datasets provided by <bold>DataKind</bold>, organized into five main categories:
    </p>
  
    <table border="1">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Dataset</th>
          <th>Focus</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Housing</td>
          <td>Availability, pricing, quality across regions</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Banking</td>
          <td>Mortgage rates, lending access, financial resources</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Environment</td>
          <td>Flood risk, pollution, proximity to services</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Economic Profile</td>
          <td>Income levels, employment rates, economic conditions</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Integrated</td>
          <td>Combined view for geographic and systemic analysis</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  
  <h2>4. Key Findings & Insights</h2>
     <h3>4.1 Demographic Disparities</h3>
       <ul>
           <li>As of 2020, Florida’s population was <bold>36.8% White, 28.3% Black, 5.2% Asian, <br/> with 26% identifying as multi-racial or from other groups </bold> including Hispanic/Latino populations.</li>
           <li>By 2022, non-Hispanic White population rose to 52.3%, but Hispanic/Latino growth led with a <bold>4.5 percentage point increase</bold>,<br/> emphasizing the state's increasing diversity.</li>
           <li><bold>Many minorities are overrepresented in high-risk flood zones</bold>, confirming environmental justice concerns (Mittan, 2020; Backenssen & Ma, 2020).</li>
       </ul>
      <h3>4.2 Housing Affordability</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>Rents increased over <bold>30%</bold> between <bold>2020 and 2022</bold>.</li>
         <li><bold>Over one-third</bold> of low-income residents now spend more than <bold>30% of income on rent</bold>, squeezing budgets for essentials.</li>
         <li>Homeownership rates <bold>(~64-65%)</bold> lag slightly behind the national average,<br/> with urban renters disproportionately impacted by rising costs.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>4.3 Financial Constraints</h3>	
      <ul>
          <li>Florida’s <bold>Purchase Applications Payment Index (PAPI)</bold> reached <bold>228</bold>, indicating one of the highest cost burdens nationally.</li>
          <li>Median mortgage payments in 2024 were <bold>$2,600/month</bold>, driven by prices exceeding <bold>$415,000</bold> and rates above <bold>7%</bold>.</li>
          <li>High denial rates and tightened lending standards disproportionately impact<br/> 
          <bold>low-income and minority applicants</bold>, especially in <bold>urban counties</bold>.</li>
      </ul>
 <h3>4.4 Environmental Risk & Exposure</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Pollution sources include <bold>plastics, phosphate mining, fertilizers</bold>, and <bold>aging infrastructure</bold>.</li>
  <li>Areas with the <bold>highest pollution levels</bold> (counties 20–27) also tend to have <bold>lower income</bold> and <br/> <bold>higher minority populations</bold>.</li>
  <li>Common environmental burdens include:
    <ul>
       <li>Wastewater contamination</li>
       <li>Air toxics</li>
       <li>Diesel pollution</li>
       <li>Lead exposure in older housing stock</li>
      </ul></li>
   </ul>

    <h3>4.5 Intersections and Systemic Risk</h3>
     <ul>
         <li>Combined analysis reveals that <bold>financial, environmental, and economic challenges are not isolated</bold>,<br/>
              but compound for certain populations.</li>
         <li>Flood-prone zones overlap with <bold>affordable housing clusters</bold>, <br/>
              forcing vulnerable residents into <bold>high-risk</bold> living situations.</li>
         <li>Environmental justice is a <bold>key lens</bold> through which housing policy must be evaluated</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Visual Insights</h2>

    <h2>6. Policy & Design Considerations</h2>
        <p>The data surfaced a number of opportunities that could inform policy and program design:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><bold>Targeted investment</bold> in affordable housing could help increase access in areas with lower environmental risk.</li>
        <li><bold>Promoting equitable lending practices</bold>, including anti-discrimination enforcement and incentives for fair credit access, may improve financial inclusion.</li>
        <li><bold>Incorporating climate resilience</bold> into housing development—particularly in coastal or flood-prone areas—could strengthen long-term stability.</li>
        <li><bold>Addressing environmental burdens</bold> in lower-income communities may contribute to improved health outcomes and livability.</li>
        <li><bold>Leveraging integrated datasets</bold> could support more responsive, data-driven decision-making across housing and environmental planning.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
       Florida’s affordable housing crisis is complex and far-reaching. It affects not just where people live, but how they live — touching everything from income and race to flood risk and health.<br/> 
       By bringing together data on housing, finances, the environment, and community demographics, this project paints a clearer picture of who is most affected and why.  
    </p>

    <p>
       This work shows that data isn’t just numbers — it’s a tool for understanding real lives.<br/>  
       When we connect the dots, we can see where systems are failing and where action is most needed.<br/>
       With the right insights, we can move toward solutions that are not only practical, but fair — helping create safer, more affordable homes for all Floridians.
